 ## Briefly about myself
 My acquaintance with information technology, programming and economics began in September 2021.  I like to learn and learn new things. At first I may be afraid of difficulties, but in the end I cope with them - this is a kind of challenge for me. I like to work in a team and easily find an approach to people. I am sociable, responsible. I like to exchange some useful skills with colleagues.
